Its a feedback Widget named Feedget, witch is positioned at the end of the html page to allow users to type a feedback content, reporting an issue, or an ideia or even other things, allow the user to take a screenshot of the html page end send it.
This feature works with tab and shift+tab, even with enter, doesnt need to use cursor pointer to complete the task.
